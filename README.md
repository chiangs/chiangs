# 👋 Hello!

I'm **Stephen**, a

~~Soldier~~, ~~Business Developer~~, ~~Operations Manager~~, ~~Full-stack Developer~~, ~~Front-end Developer~~, ~~UX Engineer~~,  

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Design Technologist`

Welcome to my corner of GitHub. Like many others, I have a ☠️ graveyard of archived code from past projects and experimentations. I've tried to curate the most current and valuable repos in the pinned section below.

Please do have a look around and consider contributing to my open source projects or project structure templates.

I'm interested in all things web and the intersection of technology and design. I am highly curious about designing _for_ technology and designing _with_ technology. Meeting the challenge of building a process that enhances the quality and depth of collaboration between design and development is what I want to make my mark on.

Usually I find myself in teams

- Championing accessibility and inclusivity.
- Implementing Design Systems and evangelising adoption.
- Introducing new technologies and standards for projects in the startup phase.
- Bringing the technological perspective and analyses to UX Research and Design activities.
- Challenging the status quo.
- Coaching and mentoring junior developers.
