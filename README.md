Welcome to my corner of GitHub. Like many others, I have a ‚ò†Ô∏è graveyard of archived code from past projects and experimentations. I've tried to curate the most current and valuable repos in the pinned section.

Please do have a look around and consider contributing to my open source projects and project structure templates.

## Contact

I'm interested in all things web and the intersection of technology and design. I am highly curious about designing _for_ technology and designing _with_ technology.

Usually I find myself in teams

- Championing accessibility and inclusivity.
- Implementing Design Systems and evangelising adoption.
- Introducing new technologies and standards for projects in the startup phase.
- Bringing the technological perspective and analyses to UX Research and Design activities.
- Challenging the status quo.
- Coaching and mentoring junior developers.
